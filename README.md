# Partition all Fivetran tables automaticly for BigQuery

### About:

Changing your Fivetran tables to partitioned tables using the _fivetran_synced fields will save you a lot of money, but it is boring and time consuming to setup if you have a lot of tables. 

This notebooks automates the process. All you have to do is to enter your project_id, your Fivetran datasets and press start.
